# potato-disease-classification
## Overview
 This project focuses on classifying diseases in potato leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 96% in identifying different diseases, providing a reliable tool for agricultural diagnostics.
Effective management of potato crops requires early and accurate identification of diseases to prevent significant yield loss. This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify potato leaf images into specific disease categories, enhancing diagnostic capabilities in agriculture.
## Categories
The CNN model categorizes potato leaves into the following classes:

Early Blight: A common fungal disease characterized by dark, concentric lesions on the leaves. Early Blight can lead to substantial crop yield reduction if not addressed promptly. The model identifies this disease by recognizing the distinctive ring-shaped patterns on the leaf surface.

Late Blight: A severe fungal disease that causes large, irregular lesions and can spread rapidly, affecting both leaves and tubers. Late Blight is particularly destructive and can cause extensive damage if not controlled. The model detects Late Blight by identifying the irregular, water-soaked appearance of the lesions.

Healthy: This category represents leaves that are free from visible diseases. Accurate classification of healthy leaves helps in distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased states, ensuring that only affected leaves are flagged for further inspection or treatment

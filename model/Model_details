Model details
Overview
The model is saved in the form of an .h5 file, with an accuracy of 96%. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consists of over 2000 images. The model was trained using this dataset.
Additionally, the model can be serialized and saved using Python's pickle module for further manipulation or storage. Here is how you can save and load the model using pickle:
import pickle

-Save the model to a file

import pickle
with open('model_saved.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(model, file)


Load the model from the file
import pickle
with open('model_saved.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
